<h1>Universal Hostel Management System</h1>

<h3>Overview:
Universal Hostel Management System is a complete solution that will be offered to hostel businesses. This system can be used for managing various activities in the hostel. For the past few years, the number of educational institutions have been increasing rapidly and so are the number of hostels. And as such, there is a lot of strain on the people who are running the hostels. This particular system deals with the problems of managing a hostel manually, while making the lives of the residents easier.
